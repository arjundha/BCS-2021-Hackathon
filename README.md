# Wanna Watch?

**Find out what your friends are watching and join in !**

Picture this it's a lonely saturday night, you have been trapped inside due to 
covid for over a year, and you're settling in to watch a new episode of Superstore. The problem?
You have no one to watch it with! Wanna Watch lets you connect with people who are also watching your 
favourite shows and movies. Can't find anyone to watch the Star Wars Prequels with? Tired of having no one around to discuss the Tiger King?
Want to watch a movie or show but have no one to do it with? Wanna Watch is your answer! Post what you are watching, scroll through others posts and 
connect with others through discord to have your own movie/tv show nights.
